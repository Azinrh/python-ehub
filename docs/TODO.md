To do list for further development of Python e-hub:
	•	*Implement just operation optimization. Currently the design and operation optimization is performed. The idea is to use ‘Capacity (kW)’  for defining predefined installed capacities and ‘Maximum Capacity’ for the upper limit for design optimization in ‘Technology’ sheet.
	•	*Implement information from ‘Network’ sheet for network layout optimization. Network layout optimization is currently implemented to optimize for all demands and all connections. 
	•	*Implement distance information from ‘Network’ sheet for investment costs/losses/etc.
	•	*Check if storage implementation 100% works.
	•	*Storage currently always has to be present for each demand in at least one hub/node.
	•	*Lifetime (yr) from ‘Technology’ sheet is not implemented.
